# Overview

- Platform for creating software based on signal flows
  - In a modular way

--
- Mainly for creating real-time sequencers
  - Control music hardware
  - Interact with midi-controllers and other input devices

--
- Embedded DSL in haskell
  - Generates C++
      - Actually more like "C with extras"...
--
- Lots of hacks and dirty code
- Have fun, don't get stuck writing a library

--
  -  Implement a language instead...? Shit happens.

---

# DSL
```haskell
def (sig1) Constant 2
def (sig2) Constant 1

(sig1 .>. sig2)
  |> onlyHigh
  |> Printer "sig1 is larger than sig2"

startBang
  |> (sig1 |+ sig2)

    
```

- Essentially meta-programming of signal chains
- Two main concepts:
  - Instantiate modules
  - Connect modules
- Compilation:
  - Build binary from haskell source
  - Run binary, generates C++
  - `make`

# Modules
- Mutable state
- Multiple inputs and multiple outputs
    - Limited range of values
- Implemented in C++

---
class: background

# Haskell as meta-language - Pros

- Parsing and structural correctness for free
- New modules from existing modules
  - Using DSL connections
- Benefit from existing language tools (ghcide)
- All the benefits of haskell
  - If you like haskell

---

# Haskell as meta-language - Cons
- Slow build times
- Awkward to map DSL constructs to decent error messages
- Lazy evaluation gets confusing sometimes
- Many more that I forget...

--
### Benefits outweigh issues by far for me right now

---
class: background

# Range checking

Naive implementation during code-gen step
  - E.g not implemented in the Haskell type-system
  - Trivial to do, and works
  - Implement any rules I know how to program
      - In normal Haskell

---
class: background

# Why not type-level implementation?

- Requires heavy use of dependent typing features
  - I'm not smart or patient enough for that
- Results in "amazing" haskell error messages
- Actually more intersted in making music tools than implementing DSLs

---
class: background

# Why do this?
* I don't like writing music
  - Would rather make it on the spot
* Play all the things at once
* Tired of bending things to my will
  - Often failing...
* Because I can

# Aren't there many tools for making custom music software?

- Yes
  - PureData, Max/MSP, MaxForLive, Reaktor, ChucK, Bidule, VCVRack, Bitwig...
- But
  - NIH
  - Mostly visual programming. I like text.
  - Too slow, prorietary, inflexible...

## None of them support all my...

# ...use cases
  - Performance instruments
    - Main motivation
    - Portable setup running on Raspberry Pi Zero
  - Collaborative music system using standard protocols
      - OSC implemented
  - Firmware for midi controllers or synths
      - Tested with Launchpad Pro
  - Algorithmic composition
  - Interactive installations.
  - VST development
  - Custom hardware devices
