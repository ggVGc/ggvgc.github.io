- Bild: modular synths:
  - Reference as design of my language
  
- Timeline: 
  - Weekend project in ChucK
  - Lua 
  - Haskell DSL (needed type-safe connections)
  - Rewrote core modules in c++:
    - Wanted to run on first pi zero, and later generate firmware code
  - Racket (faster iteration speed):
    - Uses old library as dynamic lib
    - Great language in many wayts...:
      - But development experience sucks
  - Elixir:
    - My favourite development experience. Feels like home.
    - Fast iteration speed again
    - Proper live reloading!
    - Talks to old stuff over local socket using OSC
    - Have given up on value-checked connections and code generation in order to focus on making the core setup working well.


- Things are never really working well:
  - Recently took a break to study
  - Things left in somewhat state of disarray

  
- Mistakes in the project:
  - Type-safe connections
  - Firmware thing:
    - Because launchpad pro has open source firmware
    - Nerd snipe
  - Compiling from Haskell to c++:
    - Killed iteration speed

Various issues:
  - Audio loopers:
    - Tried several things, mainly sooperlooper which everyone uses
    - Couldn't make things work the way I wanted
    - Ended up doing my own thing in ChucK
