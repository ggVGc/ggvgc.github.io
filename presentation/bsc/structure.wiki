- Personal intro:
  - Who am I?
  - What have I done and whom did I do it with?
  - Mention supervisors and thank for opportunity

- Short project intro:
  - Extension of experimental technique
  - Make more out of simpler tool
  - Mention of the two categories of samples: Inhomogeneous and "small spot"
  - Two experimental techniques which are spot focused, which we will raster.

- Description of LEED and photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES, XPS):
  - Include basic equations
  - Add figure for 2D LEED case, if time available

- Introduce samples and why they're interesting:
  - Spend most time on SiC-on-TaC

- Quick mention of Bloch and the endstation and current capabilities
- Mention previous work with raster ARPES/XPS raster scanning
