# Getting more from LEED:
## The implementation and possibilities of spatially resolved mapping
<br/>
<br/>
Valter Sundstr√∂m

Supervisors: Craig Polley, Joachim Schnadt

Location: Bloch beamline at the MAX IV Laboratory

???
I will talk about extending an existing experimental instrument.

Normally LEED measurements look like on the right. We produce what's on the left.

# Getting more from LEED:
## The implementation and possibilities of spatially resolved mapping
# 
.center[![sic_inhomogeneous_front](images/gen/sic_inhomogeneous.jpg)]
---
# Motivation

### Experimental work is costly
  - Time
  - Money
  - Complexity
  - Availability (for example beamtime)
    - Higher economic cost means fewer facilities

--

### Simpler methodologies:
- Higher accessibility
- Quicker iteration speed
- More time, more data, better data

---
# Motivation

### Do more with less
- Make spot-focused surface-sensitive techniques spatially resolved
  - Raster scanning
- Use simpler technique when possible
  - LEED instead of XPS/ARPES
  - Or as support during sample preparation

---
# Motivation

## Example: Difficult sample cleaving

???
Even if you eventually want to put your sample under deeper investigation,
there is still value in getting a quick first look.

# Techniques

- Surface sensitive
- Measurements usually taken at single location
  - We instead scan across entire sample surface
- .bold[LEED] (Low-energy electron diffraction)
  - Low-energy
  - Uses electrons to probe a surface
  - Information: crystal structure
- .bold[PES] (Photoemission spectroscopy)
  - High-energy, Low temperature (few K)
  - .bold[XPS] (X-ray), .bold[ARPES] (Angle-Resolved)
  - Based on photoelectric effect
  - Information: binding energies and energy bands

???
- LEED: Real-space unit cell
- In this way, LEED patterns can give information about the size and shape of the real space unit cell, but nothing about the positions of the atoms.
- To gain this information about atomic positions, analysis of the spot intensities is required.

Quick mention of what LEED is: Basically constructive interference.

- de Broglie wavelength relevant for treating electrons as waves, causing interference.

# .center[LEED: Reciprocal lattice]
## 2D lattice with spacings $a$ and $b$

Reciprocal unit vectors:
$$
\begin{align}
& \boldsymbol{a}^\* = \frac{2\pi }{\boldsymbol{a}}  & \boldsymbol{b}^\* = \frac{2\pi }{\boldsymbol{b}}                   \\\\
\\\\
& \boldsymbol{a} \cdot  \boldsymbol{b}^\* = \boldsymbol{b} \cdot  \boldsymbol{a}^* = 0
\end{align}
$$
where $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{b}$ are the unit vectors in real space of the surface unit cell.
Reciprocal lattice vector: 

$$\boldsymbol{G} = n \boldsymbol{a}^\* + m \boldsymbol{b}^\*$$

Produces the observed LEED pattern

# .center[Photoemission spectroscopy]
Experimental techniques based on photoelectric effect.
Measures energies of bound electrons by probing with photons.

- .bold[XPS] (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy)
  - Core electron energies
  - Chemical structure
- .bold[ARPES] (Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy)
  - Momentum measurements
  - Energy bands


???
XPS: Valence electrons hybridize, form bands

---
# .center[Photoemission spectroscopy]
Photoelectric effect:
$$E\_k = h \nu  - \phi  - E\_B$$
$\nu $ = frequency of the photon <br/>
$\phi $ = work function of the analyzer <br/>
$E_b$ = electron binding energy.

$E\_{k}$ depends on $h \nu $ used during experiment. <br/>
Data therefore generally presented with respect to
$$E - E_F = - E\_B$$
where $E_F$ is the fermi level of the sample.

# .center[Photoemission spectroscopy: ARPES]
Parallel crystal momentum of electron emitted at angle $\vartheta$ relative surface normal:

.center[
$\hbar  k\_{||} = \sqrt{2 m E\_{k}} \sin{\vartheta}$
]

.center[![arpes_analyzer](images/arpes_analyzer.png)]

???
- Measuring kinetic energy and angle gives a the parallel crystal momentum of the electron
- Crystal momentum: Momentum of electron within crystal
- Only parallel momentum is conserved
- As the electron crosses the surface barrier, 
losing part of its energy due to the surface work function, only the component of p that is parallel to the surface is preserved.

# Conclusions
- LEED raster scans show good agreement with more advanced methods, up to a limit
- Scans with LEED are an order of magnitude quicker
- Savings in time and cost make the technique compelling, when results are adequate for the situation
- A fast and low-barrier method allows for better preparation, prior to beamtime for example

???
- LEED raster scanning can quickly 
- We believe there is high value in a fast and low-barrier method for verifying expectations of a sample
- Limit reached for the graphene spots, where the LEED resolution was too low

The LEED raster scans taken during this
study were performed by a single person without prior experience in experimental work
after a short introduction to the setup, and the duration of each scan was less than one
hour. In contrast, the ARPES scan taken of the same sample was performed by a person
with expert knowledge of the system and, more importantly, required ten hours of beam
time. 

---

# Outlook
- Improvements to analysis tools
  - Spot tracking
  - Reduce analysis issues caused by imperfect orthogonal alignment of electron beam

- LEED IV-spectra
  - The control software supports full LEED control, but was not utilized in this study
