# Getting more from LEED:
## The implementation and possibilities of spatially resolved mapping
# 
.center[![sic_inhomogeneous_front](./images/gen/sic_inhomogeneous.jpg)]
???
I will talk about extending an existing experimental instrument.

Normally LEED measurements look like on the right. We produce what's on the left.

# Motivation

### Experimental work is costly
  - Time
  - Money
  - Complexity
  - Availability (for example beamtime)
    - Higher economic cost means fewer facilities


--

### Simpler methodologies:
- Higher accessibility
- Quicker iteration speed
- More and better data

---
# Motivation

### Do more with less
- Make spot-focused surface-sensitive techniques spatially resolved
  - Raster scanning
- Use simpler technique when possible
  - LEED instead of XPS/ARPES
  - Or as support during sample preparation

---
# Motivation

## Example: Difficult sample cleaving
.center[![hedgehog](./images/hedgehog_samples.jpg)]

???
Even if you eventually want to put your sample under deeper investigation,
there is still value in getting a quick first look.

# Techniques

- .bold[LEED] (Low-energy electron diffraction)
  - Uses electrons to probe a surface
  - Gives information about crystal structure
- Photoemission spectroscopy
  - Based on photoelectric effect
  - Gives information about binding energies and energy bands
  - .bold[XPS] (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy)
  - .bold[ARPES] (Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy)
- Measurements usually taken at single location
  - We instead scan across entire sample surface

Quick mention of what LEED is: Basically constructive interference.

The image shows an example LEED pattern.

# .center[LEED: Reciprocal lattice]

Reciprocal unit vectors:

.center[$
\begin{align}
& \boldsymbol{a}^\* = \frac{2\pi }{\boldsymbol{a}}  & \boldsymbol{b}^\* = \frac{2\pi }{\boldsymbol{b}}                   \\\\
\\\\
& \boldsymbol{a} \cdot  \boldsymbol{b}^\* = \boldsymbol{b} \cdot  \boldsymbol{a}^* = 0
\end{align}

where $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{b}$ are the unit vectors in real space of the surface unit cell.

Reciprocal lattice vector:

.center[
$\boldsymbol{G} = n \boldsymbol{a}^\* + m \boldsymbol{b}^\*$

# .center[Photoemission spectroscopy]
Experimental techniques based on photoelectric effect.
Measures energies of bound electrons by probing with photons.

- .bold[XPS] - X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

# .center[Photoemission spectroscopy]
Photoelectric effect:
$$E\_k = h \nu  - \phi  - E\_B$$

Generally presented as binding energy, based on fermi level:

$$E - E_F = - E\_B$$
